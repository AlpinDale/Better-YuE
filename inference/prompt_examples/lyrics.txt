     "[verse]\nStaring at the sunset, colors paint the sky\nThoughts of you keep swirling, can't deny\nI know I let you down, I made mistakes\nBut I'm here to mend the heart I didn't break", 
     "[chorus]\nEvery road you take, I'll be one step behind\nEvery dream you chase, I'm reaching for the light\nYou can't fight this feeling now\nI won't back down\nYou know you can't deny it now\nI won't back down", 
     "[verse]\nThey might say I'm foolish, chasing after you\nBut they don't feel this love the way we do\nMy heart beats only for you, can't you see?\nI won't let you slip away from me", 
     "[chorus]\nEvery road you take, I'll be one step behind\nEvery dream you chase, I'm reaching for the light\nYou can't fight this feeling now\nI won't back down\nYou know you can't deny it now\nI won't back down", 
     "[bridge]\nNo, I won't back down, won't turn around\nUntil you're back where you belong\nI'll cross the oceans wide, stand by your side\nTogether we are strong", 
     "[outro]\nEvery road you take, I'll be one step behind\nEvery dream you chase, love's the tie that binds\nYou can't fight this feeling now\nI won't back down"
